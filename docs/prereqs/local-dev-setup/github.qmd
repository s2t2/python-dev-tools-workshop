# GitHub

We'll use GitHub to manage, share, and track different versions of our software projects, called code "repositories".

## Create Account

Unless you already have one, take a moment to [create a GitHub account](https://github.com/).

Afterwards, consider signing up for the [GitHub Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack), which provides some free resources.

## Success Criteria

If successful, when you view this (or any) repository on GitHub, you should be able to click the buttons on the top-right of the page to "Star" this repository, and also optionally "Fork" it (i.e. create a copy under your own control).
