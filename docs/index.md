# Local Development Tools for Python Programming

Install and configure tools to help you manage and develop Python programs like a professional. Attendees will become familiar with development tools such as a text editor and command line application.

## Learning Objectives

1. Use GitHub Desktop software to download existing Python repositories from GitHub.
2. Utilize local development tools to write and execute Python code for research and software development.
3. Use a text editor to read, write, and save files of Python code.
4. Create and manage virtual environments using Anaconda.
5. Manage package installations effectively using pip within a virtual environment
6. use a requirements file to list package dependencies for a given project.
7. Discuss security measures needed to protect secret credentials used by research and application code.
8. Run Python programs on your computer.

## Prerequisites

This workshop requires the following software:

+ GitHub Desktop (requires a GitHub account)
+ VS Code Text Editor
+ Anaconda
+ Command Line Application (Terminal on Mac, Git Bash on Windows)

If you have never worked with these tools before, no worries, we will walk you through how to install them. Just follow the [Local Development Environment Setup Guide](./exercises//local-dev-setup/index.md). We will use a "Full Setup" for the exercises below.
